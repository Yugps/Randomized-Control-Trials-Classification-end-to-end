# Randomized-Control-Trials-Classification-end-to-end
This repository contains code and resources for classifying research articles based on their study design. The primary goal is to categorize articles  Randomized Control Trials(RCTs) into their structured form.  Project leverages preprocessing of data and techniques like embeddings, neural networks, BI LSTMS to achieve accurate classification.
The model classifies the structure into 5 classes Background,Objective,Method,Result,Conclusion.
Model can be downloaded right from the link given here once downloaded, clone the repository Extract the model folder 'RCTClassificationModel' into the cloned repository .
Model will be then accessed by App.py file itself . Model size is around 1gb
